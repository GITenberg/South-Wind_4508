description: Explores the pleasures of the hedonistic life. Set on the fictional island
  of Nepenthe (another depiction of Capri), South Wind tells the very loosely developed
  story of Thomas Heard, Bishop of Bambopo, during the season of the sirocco (south
  wind), which considerably affects the attitudes and behavior of the islanders. He
  encounters people holding various unorthodox views on moral and sexual questions.
